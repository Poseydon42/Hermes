# Hermes
Welcome to Hermes! This is my simple 3D game engine that I'm making for fun and learning. It's designed to be used in RTS and tycoon-like strategies

## History:
 - The first line of code was put down 15th February 2021
 - The first triangle was rendered on 2nd September 2021, after 5210 lines of code according to CLOC
 - The first actual 3D model was drawn on 21st October 2021 after aproximately 7200 lines of code

## Current features:
 - Uhh, well, maybe readme file is already a good feature?

## Goals:
 - Cross-platformness(Windows/Linux/MacOS)
 - Modern rendering techniques based around DX12 and/or Vulkan
 - Usefull and user-friendly UI(I hate Workers and Resources: Soviet Republic for not having one)
 - Efficient pathfinding either on graph-like structures(e.g roads, railways etc.) or terrain
 - Native and flexible support of localization
 - List goes on, those are features that I prioritize the most
